# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running The Project

Follow these steps within your command line interface (CLI) to run ***Resourcery*** on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local system using:
   `git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v55-tier2-team-26.git` 
   
2. **Navigate into the newly created project directory** using: `cd V55-tier2-team-26`

3. **Navigate into the 'front-end' directory**, 'front-end' using: `cd front-end`

4. **Install the project's dependencies** to ensure it runs smoothly: `npm install`

5. **Start the front-end development server**, launching the application in development mode with Vite using: `npm run dev`
   - This starts a local development server. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the app.

7. **Start the back-end development server**, you'll have to do steps 3,4, and 5 again but on the 'back-end', and then you can use the command: `npm run dev`

8. **Security Measures**, you'll have to create a folder named 'config' on both /front-end and /back-end folders, inside of both folders you'll need a file named *dev.env* and you'll have to add a couple of keys
   - *BACK-END KEYS AND VALUES:*
      - GEMINI_API_KEY='key'
      - JWT_SECRET='any secret here for your jwt key'
      - PORT=3000
      - IS_DEV_ENV=true
   - *FRONT-END KEYS AND VALUES:*
      - VITE_TOKEN='String of any generated jwt key to be used as a key for the back-end to receive and give access to the gemini api, the secret used should be in the back end'  

By following these steps, you should have a local instance of Resourcery running and ready for development or exploration.
