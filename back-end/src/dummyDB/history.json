That way, I receive the necessary context to understand their needs.\n\nEssentially, you're building the memory functionality *into your app*, not into me.

Instead, you should store relevant information from each interaction separately and strategically include it in subsequent requests.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* **Option 1 (Simpler, less context):**  Store key information, like the user's desired destination, dates of travel, number of passengers, etc. in variables associated with the user's session.  Before sending a new request to me, your app would include this information:  \"Find me a flight to Paris on October 26th for two people.  (Previous search:  London to Rome).\"  Only the crucial data points are carried over.\n\n* **Option 2 (More Complex, more context):**  Store more detailed history.  This might involve a more structured database storing the entire conversation thread (user's questions, my responses, etc.). You can then use this history to summarize the conversation for me before each new request.  For example: \"Previous interactions included a request for flights to Paris on October 26th, followed by a question about baggage allowance.  Now the user wants to know the price differences for different airlines.\"\n\nThe key is to organize and present the relevant context concisely and clearly within each user's query. You're not giving me a running history to read; you're providing me with the necessary background information so I can accurately and efficiently respond to the current request.  The method you choose will depend on your app's complexity and the kind of conversational memory you want to offer.\n"
